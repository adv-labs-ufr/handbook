# Advanced Lab Handbook – Quick Guide

PLESE NOTE: THIS HANDBOOK IS NOTE READY, YET

Welcome! 

This handbook is **intentionally short and practical**. It helps you navigate the Advanced Laboratory Classes (Master Laboratory–M.Sc. Physics and Physiklabor für Fortgeschrittene Lehramtstudierende–M.Ed. Physik) efficiently. Administrative items (enrolement, schedules, team assignments, quizzes, tutor contact details, grading) are handled **exclusively on [ILIAS](https://ilias.uni-freiburg.de/goto.php/crs/4019573)**.

## ⚖️ Scientific Honesty

All work in this lab follows the [Principles of Good Scientific Practice](https://www.physik.uni-freiburg.de/redlichkeit-en).
- Record every observation truthfully and in order.
- Never delete or alter raw data; annotate corrections instead.
- Cite all sources and collaborators transparently.
- Report uncertainties even when results look “wrong.”
- Uphold integrity: reproducibility > perfection.

---

## ✅ Are You Ready?

Before entering the lab, confirm you can:
- Explain your experiment’s aim and expected signals.
- Distinguish statistical from systematic uncertainties.
- Operate lab instruments safely (after tutor introduction).
- Record data in a reproducible way (chronological, clear, honest).
- Follow the institute’s safety and honesty guidelines.

You’re ready when you can check all boxes confidently.
