# Advanced Lab Handbook (Quick Guide)

This handbook is intentionally **short and practical**.  
Administrative items (schedules, team assignments, quizzes, grading, uploads) are **only on ILIAS**.

**Read this first:**
- Preparation → what to do before day 1
- Safety → rules you must follow
- Writing → IMRaD report basics
- Seminar → how to present results

For detailed methods and analysis how-tos, see **Appendix**.

```{note}
Go to the ILIAS course page for schedules, entrance/safety quizzes, grading sheets, and report uploads. This handbook hosts only open guidance.
