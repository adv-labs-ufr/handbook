# Advanced Lab Handbook – Quick Guide

Welcome!  
This handbook is **intentionally short and practical**. It helps you navigate the Advanced Laboratory Classes (FP-I, FP-II, FP-EDU) efficiently.  
Administrative items (schedules, team assignments, quizzes, grading, uploads) are handled **exclusively on [ILIAS](https://ilias.uni-freiburg.de/goto.php/crs/4019573)**.

## ✅ Are You Ready?

Before entering the lab, confirm you can:
- Explain your experiment’s aim and expected signals.
- Distinguish statistical from systematic uncertainties.
- Operate lab instruments safely (after tutor introduction).
- Record data in a reproducible way (chronological, clear, honest).
- Follow the institute’s safety and honesty guidelines.

You’re ready when you can check all boxes confidently.

## ⚖️ Scientific Honesty

All work in this lab follows the [Principles of Good Scientific Practice](https://www.physik.uni-freiburg.de/redlichkeit-en).
- Record every observation truthfully and in order.
- Never delete or alter raw data; annotate corrections instead.
- Cite all sources and collaborators transparently.
- Report uncertainties even when results look “wrong.”
- Uphold integrity: reproducibility > perfection.
