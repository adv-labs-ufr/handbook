# Seminar (if required for your course)

The seminar presentation is your opportunity to **communicate your experiment and results clearly and convincingly**.  
It complements the written report and emphasizes understanding, reasoning, and teamwork.

## Recommended flow (≈10–15 min total)

1. **Motivation (1–2 slides)**  
   - What was the experiment about?  
   - Why is it interesting or relevant in physics?  
   - State the central question or measurement goal.

2. **Theory background (2–3 slides)**  
   - Show only the **essential concepts or equations** needed to understand your method.  
   - Keep text minimal; focus on quantities that appear in your analysis.  
   - Mention sources or literature briefly (with short references on slides).

3. **Experimental setup & methods (2–3 slides)**  
   - Provide one clear schematic or photo of the setup.  
   - Highlight key components and calibration steps.  
   - Explain *how* the measurement was performed, not every minor detail.

4. **Data: from raw to processed (2–3 slides)**  
   - Show one example of **raw data** (with axes and units).  
   - Explain how you processed it — filtering, fitting, averaging, etc.  
   - Indicate how uncertainties were estimated (statistical vs systematic).

5. **Results (1–2 slides)**  
   - Present the **final quantitative result(s)** with uncertainties.  
   - Include one summary table or comparison to literature values.  
   - Discuss what limits your accuracy and what could improve it.

6. **Summary & outlook (1 slide)**  
   - Recap what you achieved, learned, and how it connects to broader physics.  
   - Mention possible extensions or improvements.

## General guidelines

- **Clarity first:** readable plots, labeled axes (with units), consistent colors and fonts.  
- **References:** include concise citations on relevant slides (author + year).  
- **Team presentation:** divide speaking parts logically; aim for balance.  
- **Timing:** 10–15 min talk + 5 min discussion unless otherwise noted.  
- **Uncertainties:** explain *how* your analysis yields the final value, not just the number.  
- **Feedback:** audiance provides short, constructive feedback directly after the seminar.
