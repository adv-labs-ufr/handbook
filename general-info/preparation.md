# Preparation

Before entering the lab, ensure you are well prepared — both conceptually and practically.

**What to do**
- Review the **physics background**: key principles, relevant parameters, and expected effects.  
- Plan your **measurement strategy**: calibration steps, data ranges, and how you will estimate uncertainties.  
- Prepare a short **entrance overview (15 min)** summarizing motivation, goals, and methods — to be discussed with your tutor.  
- Bring a **structured lab-notes template** for your measurement strategy with space for date, setup sketches, parameters, and observations — to be fine-tuned and discussed.  

**Goal:** Show that you can plan and conduct **safe, purposeful, and reproducible** experiments.
