# Prerequisites for Successful Participation

This handbook is short and on-point. Below are the **minimum expectations** to work safely and effectively in the Advanced Laboratory Classes. Details and references are collected in the **[Library](../appendix/library.md)**. Overview about all active labs are given in this handbook und **[Experiments](../experiments/readme.md)**.

**Knowledge and skills expected:**
- **Statistical methods of data analysis** and **experimental skills** (e.g., as acquired in *Physiklabor B*, B.Sc. program).
- **Experimental methods** (in Freiburg e.g. lecture *Experimentelle Methoden*).
- **Detectors & Electronics:** structure and functionality of common detector components; basics of **analog/digital circuits**.
- **Evaluation methods:** proper treatment of **statistical vs. systematic uncertainties**; ability to **calculate/estimate** both.

**Keywords:**  
`Statistical data analysis` 路 `ROOT or Python for analysis` 路 `Basics of electronics` 路 `Digital & analog measurement technology` 路 `Basics of detectors`
