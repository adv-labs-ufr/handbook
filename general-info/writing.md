# Scientific Writing (IMRaD)

- Write clearly and honestly; cite textbooks/peer-reviewed sources.
- Figures: axes labels, units, uncertainty bars; show how data → result.

**IMRaD:** Introduction • Methods • Results • Discussion  
Use the **Appendix** for fitting/uncertainty details.

```{tip}
Appendix → Templates has an IMRaD outline and example figure checklist.
