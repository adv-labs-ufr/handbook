# Data Analysis & Uncertainty

## Golden rules
- Separate **statistical** uncertainties (repeatability, noise) from **systematic** (calibration, alignment, drifts).
- **Do not** estimate systematics from deviation to literature values (methodologically invalid).
- Use calibration data and propagation of uncertainty; document assumptions.

## Checklist
- [ ] Include raw â†’ processed data path
- [ ] Show uncertainty bars and explain how you computed them
- [ ] Identify dominating systematics; quantify or bound them
- [ ] Validate fits (residuals, goodness-of-fit); avoid overinterpretation
