# Safety (read & comply)

**General safety training**  
All students and tutors must complete the official **safety instruction and quiz on ILIAS** before entering the lab.  
This covers institute-wide rules on **laser, and radiation safety**, as well as emergency procedures.

**Lab-specific safety**  
Each experiment may involve specific risks (e.g. high voltage, strong light sources, vacuum, or magnetic fields).  
Discuss these **before starting** with your **tutor** or **technical staff** to ensure that all required safety measures are understood and followed.

**Good safety practices**
- Think ahead: act so that **neither you nor others are harmed**, and that **equipment remains safe**.  
- **Discuss safe procedures** before acting — uncertainty is a reason to pause, not to proceed.  
- **Report any incidents or near-misses** immediately. Mistakes can happen; sharing them helps us all improve and prevent repetition.  
- Safety is about **learning, not blaming** — open discussion and reflection make the lab safer for everyone.

**Formal acknowledgements, quizzes, and training records are managed on ILIAS.**
