# Preparation (1-page)

- Learn the physics background (core concepts + parameters).
- Plan calibrations and measurement series.
- Prepare a 10â€“15 min entrance overview (motivation, aims, methods).
- Bring a lab-notes template (date, steps, sketches, parameters).

**Goal:** Demonstrate you can plan **safe, meaningful** measurements.
