# Data Analysis & Writing (1 page)

**Why this matters:**  
This is where data becomes a result others can trust.  
Good analysis makes your reasoning transparent and your conclusions reproducible.

## Data Analysis – fast rules
- Distinguish **statistical** (random) and **systematic** (bias) uncertainties — estimate both already in the lab.  
- **Never infer systematics** merely from deviation to literature; identify physical or instrumental sources.  
- Always show **residuals** for fits and include fit ranges, filters, and number of points (*N*).  
- Report parameter errors with proper significant figures and meaningful precision.  
- Keep plots simple and self-explanatory: axes labeled, units shown, captions concise.  
- For practical methods, see {doc}`../appendix/data-analysis/uncertainty` and {doc}`../appendix/quick-reference`.  
- If results seem inconsistent, **discuss with your tutor early** — identifying causes is part of the analysis.

## Writing – IMRaD in practice
Structure your report clearly and briefly:

- **Introduction:** goal, context, motivation, and 1–2 key references.  
- **Methods:** setup, calibration, and equations actually used.  
- **Results:** plots, parameter tables, uncertainties, and residuals.  
- **Discussion:** compare results to expectations; identify dominant systematics; suggest improvements.  

Focus on **clarity over length** — concise text with well-annotated figures communicates best.

## Final discussion & feedback
After completing your analysis and report, schedule a **final discussion** with your **tutor**.  
Use this to:
- Review your main findings and uncertainty estimates.  
- Reflect on what could be improved in measurement or analysis.  
- Clarify open questions before grading.

Tutors are asked to provide **concise, constructive, and relevant feedback** to support your continued progress as an experimental physicist.

**Submission and grading** are handled via **ILIAS** according to the course guidelines.
