# Lab Work

**Why this matters:**  
What happens at the bench determines the quality and credibility of your results.  
Your **lab notes** are your memory, evidence, and protection — they tell the story of your experiment.

---

## Before You Start
- Confirm all required **ILIAS safety trainings** are completed (general and laser/radiation, if relevant).  
- Perform a quick **instrument check**: power, cables, grounding, probe settings (1× / 10×), interlocks, shutters.  
- Open your **lab notebook** and record:
  - Title, names of team members, date, start time  
  - Setup sketch with labels, serial numbers, and software versions

## Lab Notes – Essentials (non-negotiable)
- Write **chronologically** what you do and *why*: actions → observations → immediate results.  
- Log **all parameters** with units; include file names, timestamps, and software versions.  
- Paste quick plots or screenshots to document checks.  
- **Never delete** entries or raw data — annotate corrections and sign each session.  
- Structure your entries: *Goal · Procedure · Observation · Comment*.

## While Measuring
- Save raw data with **clear filenames**; back up to the shared location regularly.  
- Make quick plots to detect problems early (range, noise, drift, scaling).  
- **Estimate uncertainties already on site** — both *statistical* (spread of data) and *systematic* (instrument limits, misalignment, drift).  
- **Discuss these estimates with your tutor** during the measurement.  
- Seek **regular guidance at least three times per day** to confirm progress, check methods, and adjust the plan if needed.  
- If unexpected behavior or equipment issues occur, **inform tutors or organizers immediately** — not to assign blame, but to help resolve problems early and safely.

---

## End of Day
- Confirm all data are saved and backed up; mark final versions in notes.  
- Summarize key findings: what worked, what failed, what to improve next session.  
- Secure light sources and electrical equipment; tidy up your workspace.  
- Sign your notebook and confirm that tutors and organizers are aware of any technical or safety concerns.

**Remember:**  
Good lab work thrives on openness, precision, and teamwork.  
Estimating uncertainties early, asking questions, and reporting issues promptly protect both your results and your colleagues.
