# Lab Work (How to work in the room)

**Why this matters:** What you do at the bench decides your result’s quality. Good **lab notes** are your memory, evidence, and protection.

## Before you start (2 min)
- Confirm **ILIAS safety trainings** are done (general + laser/radiation if relevant).
- Quick **instrument check**: power, cables, grounding, probe 1×/10×, interlocks/shutters.
- Open your **lab notebook**: Title · Names · Date/Time · Setup sketch with labels/serials.

## Lab notes – essentials (non-negotiable)
- Write **chronologically** what you do and why (actions → observations → immediate result).
- Log **parameters** (units!), file names, timestamps, software versions; paste quick plots.
- **Never delete** entries or raw data; **annotate** corrections. Sign each session.

## While measuring
- Save raw data with **clear filenames**; back up to agreed location regularly.
- Make quick plots to catch issues early (range, noise, drift, units).
- Record **changes** explicitly (who/when/what/why).

## End of day (2-minute checklist)
- Data saved + backup confirmed; mark versions in notes.
- Summarize what worked/failed; list **next steps**.
- Secure sources/lasers; tidy and power down as required.
- Sign your notes; inform tutor of any safety/equipment concerns.
