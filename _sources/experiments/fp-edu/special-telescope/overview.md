# Special – Telescope

**Focus:** Understanding how telescopes reveal the Universe — from optical principles to data interpretation — and how such observations can enrich physics teaching.

---

## Learning goals
- Explain how **telescope design and resolution** affect image quality.  
- Relate **instrumental limitations** (seeing, tracking, optics) to data accuracy.  
- Use **filters and detectors** to study light properties and astronomical objects.  
- Create and interpret a **Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (HRD)** for a star cluster.  
- Reflect on how such experiments can be integrated into **school or outreach activities**.

---

## Preparation
Review:
- Basic **optics of telescopes** (aperture, focal length, magnification).  
- **Electromagnetic spectrum** and detector response.  
- **Stellar structure and evolution**, cluster HR diagrams, and spectral classification.  
- Safe procedures for **solar observation** (filters, never observe directly).  

Bring ideas on how to **translate astronomical observation** into classroom teaching.

## Core activities
1. **Resolution and image quality**
   - Design a simple test to measure telescope resolution.  
   - Determine the **diffraction limit** and compare with Hubble and JWST data.  
   - Discuss practical limits: seeing, alignment, guiding, and optical aberrations.

2. **Filters and light analysis**
   - Investigate transmission of **broad-, medium-, and narrow-band filters**.  
   - Explore how filters improve contrast and reveal specific physical processes.  
   - Consider how filter choice affects color, intensity, and interpretation.

3. **Observation projects (weather dependent)**
   - **Daytime:** solar imaging with certified filters; note solar activity features.  
   - **Nighttime:** record images of **open clusters** or nearby star fields; log conditions.

4. **Data processing**
   - Apply basic **image calibration** (dark, bias, flat-field).  
   - Perform **photometry** and construct an **HR diagram**.  
   - Discuss age and metallicity estimation from photometric data.

5. **Comparison and reflection**
   - Compare your findings with theoretical models of stellar evolution.  
   - Identify **sources of uncertainty** (instrumental, atmospheric, methodological).  
   - Reflect on how these concepts can be **taught or demonstrated** in schools.

## Safety
- Follow all general laboratory safety rules.  
- For **solar observations**, use approved filters **at all times** — never look directly at the Sun through optics.  
- Handle delicate optics and mounts carefully; consult technical staff if unsure.

---

## Discussion and reflection
Conclude with a **joint discussion**:  
- What did you learn scientifically and pedagogically?  
- How could such experiments inspire students’ curiosity in astronomy?  
- Tutors will provide **focused feedback** on both the physics and the didactic perspective.
