# Optical Pumping — Overview

**Aim (1–2 lines):**  
Measure Zeeman splitting and relaxation times in Rubidum vapors using optical pumping and radio-frequency transitions.

**You will (bullets):**
- Align the optics and set up magnetic field coils with calibrated current supplies.
- Record transmission signals while sweeping RF frequency and magnetic field strength.
- Determine g-factors/relaxation times with uncertainty estimates from fits and calibration data.
