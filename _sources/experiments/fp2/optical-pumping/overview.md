# Optical Pumping

**Goal**  
Investigate optical pumping in rubidium atoms. Observe population redistribution in magnetic sublevels under circularly polarized light and study magnetic resonance phenomena.

**Learning outcomes**
- Explain how circularly polarized light induces spin polarization.  
- Measure Zeeman splittings and relate them to the applied magnetic field.  
- Discuss relaxation mechanisms and their influence on signal shape.

---

## Before the Lab

Be ready to:
- Sketch the **D₁ level scheme** of Rb including hyperfine and Zeeman structure.  
- Explain in one sentence what *optical pumping* achieves.  
- Recall how a **quarter-wave plate** produces circular polarization.  
- Review **laser safety** and handling of optical components.

**Preparation hints**
- Identify typical Zeeman splittings in μT fields.  
- Review the concept of population difference and resonance condition.  
- Consider which parameters may limit your measurement precision.

## In the Lab

Focus on:
- Recording stable spectra and calibrating frequency or magnetic field scales.  
- Checking polarization and verifying resonance conditions.  
- Performing **pre-analysis**:  
  - Inspect raw data for noise, drift, or offset.  
  - Discuss with your tutor how to define **statistical** vs **systematic** uncertainties.  
  - Plan how to extract one quantitative result (e.g., g-factor or relaxation time).

**Typical discussion topics**
- Definition and estimation of measurement uncertainty.  
- Influence of light power and magnetic field homogeneity.  
- Choice of fit model and how to judge its validity.

## After the Lab

Perform a **concise data analysis**:
- Plot the key measurement and annotate relevant parameters.  
- Quantify one result with uncertainty and compare to literature.  
- Discuss possible sources of error and their impact.

**Writing focus**
- *Method section:* describe setup, measured quantities, and calibration steps briefly and clearly.  
- *Results section:* present one central figure, one quantitative table, and one paragraph interpretation.  
- *Discussion:* connect findings to physical principles and note limitations.

Keep your report short (less than ten pages + figures).
