# Optical Pumping — Overview

**Aim (1–2 lines):**  
Measure Zeeman splitting and relaxation times in alkali vapors using optical pumping and radio-frequency transitions.

**You will do (bullets):**
- Align the optics and set up magnetic field coils with calibrated current supplies.
- Record transmission signals while sweeping RF frequency and magnetic field strength.
- Determine g-factors/relaxation times with uncertainty estimates from fits and calibration data.

**Notes:**
- Submit lab notes and report via **ILIAS** (link on course page).
- Keep lab notes chronological; include sketches, parameters, and preliminary plots.
