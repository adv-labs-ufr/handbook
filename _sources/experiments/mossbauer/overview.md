# Mössbauer Spectroscopy — Overview

**Aim (1–2 lines):**  
Resolve hyperfine splitting in iron-containing samples and extract isomer shift and magnetic field parameters.

**You will do (bullets):**
- Calibrate the velocity drive using a reference absorber.
- Measure transmission spectra for absorber(s) at multiple temperatures or fields.
- Fit resonance lines to obtain shifts/splittings with propagated uncertainties.

**Experimental details:**

**Notes:**
- Submit lab notes and report via **ILIAS** (link on course page).
- Keep lab notes chronological; include sketches, parameters, and preliminary plots.
