# Experiments Overview

The experiments in this handbook are now grouped by track to make it easier to find the material that matches each course offering:

- **FP1** – core experiments for the first advanced lab course.
- **FP2** – experiments for the second advanced lab course.
- **FP Edu (Specials)** – outreach, special topics, or education-focused experiments.

Each experiment folder contains:

1. An `overview.md` page that is included in the book navigation.
2. Supporting assets such as PDFs, data files, or notebooks.
3. A reusable `README_template.md` based on the shared experiment template. Copy or rename this file when creating new material and replace the placeholder text with experiment-specific content.

To add a new experiment:

1. Choose the appropriate track (`fp1`, `fp2`, or `fp-edu`).
2. Duplicate the template (`README_template.md`) into a working file (for example, `guide.md` or `overview.md`).
3. Update `_toc.yml` so the new page appears in the navigation under the correct track.
4. Keep resource links relative to the experiment folder to preserve portability.

For a quick reference to the template, see [`templates/experiment-template.md`](../templates/experiment-template.md).
