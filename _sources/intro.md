# Advanced Lab Handbook – Quick Guide

Welcome!  
This handbook is **intentionally short and practical**. It helps you navigate the Advanced Laboratory Classes (FP-I, FP-II, FP-EDU) efficiently.  
Administrative items (schedules, team assignments, quizzes, grading, uploads) are handled **exclusively on [ILIAS](https://ilias.uni-freiburg.de/goto.php/crs/4019573)**.

  A(Preparation) --> B(Safety) --> C(Lab Work) --> D(Data Analysis & Writing) --> E(Seminar · if required)
```

Read order (short pages):
1. Prerequisites → what you’re expected to know before starting
2. Preparation → complete your plan for day 1
3. Safety → confirm ILIAS trainings; know rules and contacts
4. Lab Work → how to work in the room (lab notes! instruments! data handling!)
5. Data Analysis & Writing → turn data into results; IMRaD report
6. Seminar (if required) → present results effectively

## 🎯 Section Purpose – “Why This Matters”

| Section | Focus | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Preparation | Before Day 1 | Complete these steps to hit the ground running. |
| Safety | During lab work | Protect yourself and others; required for lab access. |
| Lab Work | Core activity | Apply scientific methods with precision and care; document everything. |
| Data Analysis & Writing | After measurements | Turn measurements into results and communicate them clearly. |
| Seminar | Final presentation | Share findings effectively with your peers. |

## ✅ Are You Ready?

Before entering the lab, confirm you can:
- Explain your experiment’s aim and expected signals.
- Distinguish statistical from systematic uncertainties.
- Operate lab instruments safely (after tutor introduction).
- Record data in a reproducible way (chronological, clear, honest).
- Follow the institute’s safety and honesty guidelines.

You’re ready when you can check all boxes confidently.

## ⚖️ Scientific Honesty

All work in this lab follows the [Principles of Good Scientific Practice](https://www.physik.uni-freiburg.de/redlichkeit-en).
- Record every observation truthfully and in order.
- Never delete or alter raw data; annotate corrections instead.
- Cite all sources and collaborators transparently.
- Report uncertainties even when results look “wrong.”
- Uphold integrity: reproducibility > perfection.
