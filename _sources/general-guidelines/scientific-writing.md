# Scientific Writing (IMRaD)

## Principles
- **Honesty & clarity**: write in your own words, cite properly.
- **Concise**: prefer clear, short sentences over storytelling.
- **Reproducible**: figures with axes labels, units, and uncertainty bars.

## IMRaD
- **Introduction**: motivation, background, aim, hypothesis.
- **Methods**: setup, procedures, models, and formulas used.
- **Results**: data presentation with uncertainties; how analysis was performed.
- **Discussion**: key findings vs aim; limits; improvements.

**References** must be citable (textbooks, peer-reviewed), not old student reports.
