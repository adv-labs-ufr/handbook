# Uncertainty – Practical Guide

**Do:**
- Separate **statistical** (repeatability/noise) from **systematic** (calibration, alignment, drift).
- Quantify or bound systematics via calibrations and controls.
- Use calibration data and propagation of uncertainty; document assumptions.

**Don’t:**
- ❌ Estimate systematics from the deviation to literature values.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Show raw → processed steps
- [ ] Report uncertainties with method used
- [ ] Identify dominant systematics and their effect size
- [ ] Validate fits (residuals, χ²/DOF or equivalent)
- [ ] Include uncertainty bars and explain how you computed them

**Further reminders:**
- Include raw-to-processed data pathways in your report or lab notes.
- Highlight which assumptions drive systematic bounds.
- Discuss goodness-of-fit metrics to avoid overinterpreting noisy data.
