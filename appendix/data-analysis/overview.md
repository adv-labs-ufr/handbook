# Data Analysis â€“ Overview

Use this appendix for detailed methods:
- Uncertainty propagation (statistical vs systematic)
- Model fitting (residuals, goodness-of-fit)
- Background modeling (e.g., linear + Gaussian)
- Bootstrap / resampling (when and why)

Main pages stay short; link here when depth is needed.
