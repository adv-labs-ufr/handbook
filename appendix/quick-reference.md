### General Safety
**Safety training valid for 12 month and needs to be completed on [ILIAS](https://ilias.uni-freiburg.de/goto.php/crs/4019573)** before day one in the lab.

**Why this matters:**
General procedures are your first line of defence against accidents and protect the wider lab community.
Shared spaces stay safe and efficient only when everyone follows the same baseline rules.
Completing formal training ensures you understand expectations before touching equipment.
- [ ] Know the locations of emergency exits, extinguishers, and the first aid kit.  
- [ ] Do not work alone after hours; approved working hours: **09:00‚Äì17:30**.  
- [ ] Keep lab areas tidy; no food or drinks in lab rooms.  
- [ ] Report all incidents, spills, or unsafe conditions to your tutor immediately.  
- [ ] Read and sign all relevant safety instructions before your first experiment.  


(laser-safety-card)=
### Laser Safety
**Why this matters:**  
Lasers can cause permanent eye or skin injury and invisible hazards due to infrared or ultraviolet radiation.  
Following proper laser-safety rules protects you and everyone sharing the lab.  
Even low-power beams can be dangerous when misaligned or unmonitored.

- [ ] Eye protection worn when Class 3B or 4 lasers are active; correct wavelength range verified.  
- [ ] Beam paths clearly marked; no stray reflections toward eye level.  
- [ ] Optical tables free of unnecessary optics; unused beams dumped securely.  
- [ ] Shutters and interlocks tested before activation; never bypass safety circuits.  
- [ ] Reflective objects (watches, jewelry, tools) removed near active setups.  
- [ ] Power levels, filters, and alignment procedures logged in lab notes.  
- [ ] Never align a laser ‚Äúby eye‚Äù ‚Äî use cards, viewers, or low-power alignment beams.  


(radiation-safety-card)=
### Radiation Safety
**Why this matters:**  
Handling radioactive sources requires heightened awareness and adherence to legal protocols.  
Radiation protection safeguards not only you but all future users of the facility.  
Training and strict adherence to procedures are mandatory under German radiation law.

- [ ] Only trained and authorized persons may handle or move radioactive sources.  
- [ ] Dosimeter (if required) worn visibly and returned after the experiment.  
- [ ] Sources remain in shielded containers when not in use; log all transfers.  
- [ ] No food, drinks, or personal items in radiation areas.  
- [ ] Hands washed after any source handling.  
- [ ] Any loss, irregularity, or suspected contamination reported immediately to the tutor and safety officer.

### Electrical & High-Voltage Safety
**Why this matters:**  
Most laboratory injuries come from avoidable electrical mistakes.  
Understanding current paths and isolation prevents shocks, damage, and downtime.  
Proper grounding and awareness keep both you and your setup safe.

- [ ] Check cables and connectors for damage before use.  
- [ ] Never touch a circuit when powered unless explicitly designed for low voltage.  
- [ ] Ground all measurement devices consistently; avoid ground loops.  
- [ ] Discharge capacitors before adjusting circuits.  
- [ ] Never override safety interlocks on HV supplies.  
- [ ] Verify correct polarity and limit settings before enabling output.  

---

### Vacuum and Cryogenic Safety
**Why this matters:**  
Vacuum and cryogenic systems involve implosion, asphyxiation, and frostbite hazards.  
These systems often store large energies or cold liquids invisible to the eye.  
Following procedures prevents accidents and protects sensitive instrumentation.

- [ ] Ensure all glass parts are shielded or rated for vacuum.  
- [ ] Vent systems slowly; avoid rapid pressure changes.  
- [ ] Do not expose cryogenic liquids to air (oxygen condensation risk).  
- [ ] Wear cryo gloves and face protection when handling cold components.  
- [ ] Check pump oil levels and trap conditions before use.
