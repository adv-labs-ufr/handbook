## Report (IMRaD) Outline

**Title, Authors, Date**
**Abstract** (<200 words): aim, method, main result with uncertainties.

### Introduction
Motivation, background, aim, hypothesis; short literature context.

### Methods
Setup (with schematic), procedures, models, relevant formulas and constants.

### Results
Key plots with labeled axes and uncertainty bars; fit details and parameter tables.

### Discussion
Main takeaways; compare to expectations; identify statistical vs systematic limits; propose improvements.

### References
Textbooks and peer-reviewed articles (incl. DOIs).

> Appendix: upload lab notes and code via ILIAS according to course rules.

## Slide Checklist (Seminar)

- Flow: motivation → theory → setup/methods → data → results → summary
- Timing: ~40 min talk (+20 min discussion)
- Figures: readable labels, units, legends; discuss each figure you show
- Depth: explain how raw data becomes the final result (include uncertainties)
- Citations on slides where concepts/results are used

## Lab Notes – Page Structure

- Header: date, experiment title, team members, tutor signature space
- Chronological entries with times, actions, instrument settings, sketches
- Tables for parameters, calibrations, raw measurements, and uncertainty notes
- Space for quick plots or pasted printouts; reference file names for digital data

## Preparation Plan Template

- Review experiment background (theory, methods, typical parameter ranges).
- Collect relevant references (textbooks, peer-reviewed papers).
- Draft a 10–15 min entrance overview (motivation, aims, core methods, expected signals).
- Prepare a measurement plan with calibration steps and uncertainty targets.

## Safety Quick Reference

- Follow institute rules (laser/radiation/electrical safety).
- Wear appropriate PPE and **never** bypass interlocks.
- Ask tutors to review risky steps before executing.
- Record any incidents immediately and report them to tutors.

## Using This Handbook

- Read the Preparation and Safety sections before your first lab day.
- Keep detailed lab notes (chronological, legible, with sketches).
- Apply the Data Analysis guidance to separate statistical vs systematic effects.
- Follow the report outline above when writing up your IMRaD document.
- Refer to ILIAS for schedules, quizzes, grading sheets, and uploads.
