# Raman Spectroscopy — Overview

**Aim (1–2 lines):**  
Measure Raman shifts of reference samples to identify vibrational modes and determine the spectrometer calibration.

**You will do (bullets):**
- Align and calibrate the spectrometer using known emission lines.
- Record Raman spectra for solids/liquids with different characteristic peaks.
- Fit peak positions/intensities and estimate uncertainties from calibration and counting noise.

**Notes:**
- Submit lab notes and report via **ILIAS** (link on course page).
- Keep lab notes chronological; include sketches, parameters, and preliminary plots.
