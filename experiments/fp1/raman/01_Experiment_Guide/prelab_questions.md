# üß© Pre-Lab Preparation Questions

Before entering the lab, take a few minutes to think through the following questions.  
They are designed to guide your preparation for the Raman experiment.  
You can expand each section to reveal example answers and verify your understanding.

<details>
<summary><strong>1Ô∏è‚É£ Why is laser safety particularly important in this experiment?</strong></summary>
<p>Visible lasers (532 nm and 633 nm) are <strong>Class 3B / 4</strong>, meaning they can cause <strong>eye damage even from scattered light</strong>. Proper laser goggles, enclosed beam paths, and an active interlock system are mandatory.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2Ô∏è‚É£ What is the function of the interlock system?</strong></summary>
<p>The interlock automatically <strong>disables laser emission</strong> when the optical enclosure is open. This ensures no stray beam leaves the system during alignment or maintenance.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3Ô∏è‚É£ Why should all optical components be cleaned before alignment?</strong></summary>
<p>Dust or residue can cause <strong>uncontrolled reflections</strong> and <strong>scatter light</strong>, which not only increases background noise but can also create dangerous stray beams.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4Ô∏è‚É£ What is the role of the Hg and Na lamps in this setup?</strong></summary>
<p>They provide <strong>known spectral reference lines</strong> for <strong>wavelength calibration</strong> of the spectrometer before Raman measurements.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5Ô∏è‚É£ Why do we start alignment at low laser power?</strong></summary>
<p>Lower power minimizes the risk of <strong>eye exposure</strong> and <strong>damage to optics</strong>, allowing safe coarse alignment before increasing power for measurement.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>6Ô∏è‚É£ What is the purpose of the cooling system?</strong></summary>
<p>It maintains a <strong>stable laser temperature (&lt; 40 ¬∞C)</strong>, preventing wavelength drift and ensuring long-term operational stability.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>7Ô∏è‚É£ How is the scattered light collected in the Raman geometry?</strong></summary>
<p>The Raman signal is collected <strong>at 90¬∞ to the excitation beam</strong> via an optical fiber connected to the spectrometer. This geometry suppresses direct reflection and isolates the inelastic (Raman) component.</p>
