# Experiments Overview

The experiments in this handbook are organized according to the **study tracks and course modules** of the Physics program at the University of Freiburg.  
This grouping helps you quickly find the experiments relevant to your current course or degree path.

### **FP1 – Advanced Laboratory I**

Core experiments of the *first advanced lab course* for **B.Sc. Physics** students.  
Focus: fundamentals of modern experimental physics, measurement techniques, data evaluation, and scientific reporting.  
Students typically complete two to three experiments within this module.

---

### **FP2 – Advanced Laboratory II**

Experiments for the *second advanced lab course*, primarily aimed at **M.Sc. Physics** students.  
Focus: specialized methods, in-depth data analysis, and experiments closer to current research topics in atomic, molecular, solid-state, and nuclear physics.  
The FP2 course builds on FP1 and prepares students for independent research and master’s thesis work.

### **FP Edu**

Experiments developed for **Physics Education** designed for **M.Ed. Physics** students.  
Focus: conceptual understanding, didactic translation of experimental setups, and creative projects that link research and education.
