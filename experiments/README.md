# Experiments Overview

The experiments in this handbook are organized according to the **study tracks and course modules** of the Physics program at the University of Freiburg. This grouping helps you quickly find the experiments relevant to your current course or degree path.

---

### **FP1 – Advanced Laboratory I – 7 ECTS**

Core Core experiments of the first advanced lab course for **B.Sc. Physics** students. Focus: fundamentals of modern experimental physics, measurement techniques, data evaluation, and scientific reporting. Students typically complete seven experiments, each requiring two lab days. The FP I module provides the foundation for systematic experimental work and prepares students for advanced research-oriented labs.

---

### **FP2 – Advanced Laboratory II – 8 ECTS**

Experiments of the second advanced lab course, primarily for **M.Sc. Physics** students. Focus: specialized experimental methods, in-depth data analysis, and experiments closely related to current research topics in atomic, molecular, solid-state, and nuclear physics. Students typically complete three experiments, comprising one short experiment (one week) and two extended experiments (two weeks each). FP II builds upon the principles of FP I and prepares students for independent research and their master’s thesis work.

### **FP Education – 5 ECTS**

Experiments developed for **M.Ed. Physics** students, combining fundamental and didactic aspects of experimental physics. The FP Edu module includes three short experiments (each over two days) and one extended project (one week):
- The short experiments introduce the fundamentals of modern experimental physics, including measurement techniques, data evaluation, and scientific reporting.
- The one-week project emphasizes the conceptual understanding of modern research topics and their didactic translation into teaching practice. It culminates in a creative seminar presentation, linking research principles with communication skills and the ability to convey complex concepts to an audience.

Each experiment page provides:
- **Concise preparation hints** and learning goals.  
- **Guidance for lab work** and in-situ discussions with tutors.  
- **Compact analysis and reporting tips**, aligned with grading criteria.
