# Special – Telescope Experiment — Overview

**Status:** Draft outline prepared with the shared experiment template. Flesh out the sections as the outreach activities and observing plans take shape.

**Getting started:**
- Consult the [`README_template.md`](README_template.md) to map out preparation, safety, and data collection tasks.
- Document telescope alignment procedures and viewing targets as they are confirmed.
- Record data logging or citizen-science submission workflows for participants.

```{tip}
Tailor the template language for public-facing events to keep expectations clear for facilitators and students.
